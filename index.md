## What is this?
---
Here I will be posting most of my projects. What projects you ask? Well, currently I'm working on three things:
- [Quantitative Finance](https://github.com/whateverhappns/quantproject.git), which is currently private.
  - Here the main goal is to familiarize myself with the state of the art concepts in quantitative finance. Right now, I'm working on [hidden Markov models.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model)
