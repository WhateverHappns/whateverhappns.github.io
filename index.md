## What is this?
---
:tiger:

Here I will be posting most of my projects. What projects you ask? Well, currently I'm working on three things:
- [Quantitative Finance](https://github.com/whateverhappns/quantproject.git), which is currently private.
  - Here the main goal is to familiarize myself with the state of the art concepts in quantitative finance. Right now, I'm working on [hidden Markov models.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model)
  
- [SmartHub](https://github.com/whateverhappns/smarthub.git) is an app which I'm developing. I am not quite sure on what it's exact purpose will be. Certainly, it will not be something which I hope to scale up, but more like something for a minority of individuals. It will try to provide **truly new** content to the user. You know how on most social media platforms you get recommended the same stuff all the time? Well, there's a saying that, 
    > You don't know what you don't know.

and so I thought I'd create an app/website/environment where you can find out new material to study.
