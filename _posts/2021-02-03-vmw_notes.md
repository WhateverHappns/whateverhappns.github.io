# Value, Money & Wealth (Notes):
--- 

## Goal setting:
- One sum (e.g. $1M)
	- When?
	- Generally bad idea
- ARR (e.g. $50k)
	- More feasible + better idea
	- Doesn't require as much capital
	- Compounding -> $1M as mentioned above 

# Value 
- Bring value to something monetizable => money
	- Can be as simple as 1+2=3 if sticking the two together is too much effort for your target audience
- The higher the risk, the greater the potential returns
	- but also downside
- Supply & Demand
- Ebay liquidating example
	- limited supply

# Financial Vehicles:
## Annual-Recurring Revenue:
- SaaS
	- User-facing (e.g. not for other developers)
	- Simple CRUD Apps with API:
		- Mobile Apps & Websites
		- Monetization: Ads, Subscription based, Donations (eh)
		- Funnels
		- Running costs

- Property (Real Estate):
	- "Location is everything" 
		- general advice 
	- Mentor under somebody
		- but introvert & shit
	- Financing seems to be 90% of it
		- loans, deals etc.
		- high initial capital required/better
		- the better the credit score the bigger the profits
	- Renting/Flipping houses
		- Renting seems to be better especially for ARR
		- Look into exact logistics of renting

- Stock market & Forex
	- Safe: ETFs if picked right
		- ~7-13% per year
		- some vanguard ETFs seem to get up to 20%
			- annually though?
	- Value investing -> buy the dip
	- Trading -> insanity (?)
		- generally short and small alphas
		- profit/effort is small

- Books, Podcasts, Courses etc.
	- What do you call this category?
	- Books seem to be a good source of income if successful but otherwise waste of time
	- Podcasts & Courses can be lucrative 

- Starting a business
	- have to provide value otherwise worthless
	- highest risk -> highest reward
	- very good idea necessary
		- but also execution & planning
	- never give up more than 50% of the company and watch who can vote you out 
	- Easy way*:
		- Give good presentation -> Overpromise -> VCs and Angel Investors invest billions
		- Note that Facebook didn't raise >$1B before being ~9 yrs old
		- *Also leads to failure & bankruptcy
